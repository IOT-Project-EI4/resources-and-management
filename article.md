# Carrotech : a plantation-integrated smart farming device

## image of the final product

As part of an engineering school project, we have aimed to create a reliable smart farming device capable of sending precise data on humidity, temperature, COâ‚‚ level, luminosity, and light spectrum.

The device measures humidity and temperature in two locations: deep underground and at the surface, in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

The final purpose is to have a web-accessible interface for the user, allowing them to visualize all useful data to manage their crops.
