# Carrotech : a plantation-integrated smart farming device

## image of the final product

As part of an engineering school project, we have aimed to create a reliable smart farming device capable of sending precise data on humidity, temperature, CO₂ level, luminosity, and light spectrum.

The device measures humidity and temperature in two locations: deep underground and at the surface, in order to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

The final purpose is to have a web-accessible interface for the user, allowing them to visualize all useful data to manage their crops.

# Carrotech : the smart farming revolution, the eco-monitoring solution

## [image of the final product]

Since long, technology has been integral to agriculture and farm management, but with advancements in IoT and tool conception, smart farming now takes a whole new and more evolved dimension. In this context, Carrotech aims to leverage IoT techniques via Low Power connectivity and a sensor network in order to create a reliable smart farming device capable of sending precise data on humidity, temperature, CO₂ level, luminosity, and light spectrum.

The retrieved and transmitted data from the device sensors is subsequently displayed on a web-accessible interface for users and farmers to monitor plant and greenhouse conditions in real time with the highest possible accuracy and manage their crops.

Carrotech is the culmination of an engineering school project in IoT and embedded systems and shall serve the greenhouse of the Sorbonne Université researh campus in Saint-Cyr, Paris.
